# Spotify-clone
Spotify clone using html and css
A static Spotify-like web page built only with HTML and CSS. It reproduces the visual layout and basic interactive feel (hover effects, active states) of Spotify’s interface — sidebar, search/top bar, playlists grid, and a fixed “now playing” bar — without any real audio playback or JavaScript logic. Good for a portfolio piece that shows layout, responsive design, and advanced CSS skills.
